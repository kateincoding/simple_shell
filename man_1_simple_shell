.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "April 2021" "Holberton School" "Linux Programmers Manual"

.SH NAME
       Based in bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell
       simple_shell - command language interpreter that reads from standard input

.SH SYNOPSIS
       bash [options] [command_string | file]

       .B gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
       .B ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
       Bash  is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates use‚Äê
       ful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

       Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).  Bash can
       be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.

.TP
\fB Return (Exit Value) \fR

Upon termination of the simple shell program, an exit value will be set according to the status of the last command
executed. If the command ran succesfuly, the exit value will be zero (0).

.TP
\fBFORMAT OF COMMAND INPUT\fR

The simple shell can work in two different modes, \fIinteractive\fR and \fInon-interactive\fR. In both modes, commands
can be written with their absolute path or simply their executable name if they exist in one of the folders defined by
PATH.

Example:

\fB/bin/ls\fR is the same as \fBls\fR (ls exists in one of the PATH folders)


.IP \fB-Interactive Mode:\fR

In this condition, the shell will display a prompt ($) that will indicate that the user can provide commands by writing them
with a keyboard. In order to execute the commands the user will need to press the enter key (new line).

Each time a command is executed, the prompt will reappear and wait for a new user input.

Example:

\fBvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$\fR ./hsh

$ ls

file1 file2 dira dirb

$

In order to exit the simple shell, the user must press the combination CTRL + D, as the CTRL + C signal is reserved only for internal script termination and it does not exit the shell.

.IP \fB-Non-interactive Mode:\fR

In this condition, the shell will run commands provided through a pipe at the moment of execution, and will not display a prompt
($) or wait for new user input:

Example:

\fBvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$\fR echo "ls" | ./hsh

file1 file2 file3 file4

\fBvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/simple_shell$\fR
